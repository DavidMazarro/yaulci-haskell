# yaulci-haskell

*Yet Another Untyped Lambda Calculus Implementation* (YAULCI) in Haskell.

### Why does this exist?
Two simple reasons:
- I had been wanting to do this for quite a while, just to toy around
- It's part of an assignment for a programming language theory course in my master's degree, so might as well turn it into a public repo/library
